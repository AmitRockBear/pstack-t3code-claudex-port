# Poteto help

Answer the user's question about pstack, hand them a prompt they can send, and link the file the answer came from. For a help question, don't start the work. The user asked how, and a pstack run spends real tokens, so let them send the prompt.

For an explicitly activated Pstack task, read [`poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) and follow its playbook. A help question produces advice and a prompt, not execution.

Read the matching installed skill or playbook before answering. In T3, read [profile routing](../poteto-mode/references/claudep-routing.md); it owns activation, models, effort and child lifecycle. Link the actual installed file by its absolute path. Label public upstream links as upstream guidance because local policy may differ.

## Find out what they need

Infer the need from the message and the conversation. A named situation, such as "which skill reviews a PR?", goes straight to its section. If the need is still unclear, ask one multiple-choice question with these options, then answer only the section they pick:

- Get set up
- Start a task with `/poteto-mode`
- Pick a skill for a situation
- Fix a run that went wrong
- Make pstack my own

Check the state that changes the answer, and mention it only when it does:

- Read `~/.pstack/pstack-models.md` for configured roles and efforts. Use `orchestrator_capabilities` when an answer depends on live provider or option availability.
- For races, invariants or cases tests rarely reach, use [create-formal-verification-skill](../create-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md); use [maintain-formal-verification-skill](../maintain-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md) when covered code changed after its recorded sync commit.
- For verification, read the shared [verify-change](../verify-change/SKILL.md) and the project driver before proposing a new verification skill. Implemented-change UI checks follow the existing explicit-request rule.

When the model rule is missing and it matters, ask whether the user wants to pick a model for each role and a reasoning budget now. It matters when the user is new, the question is about setup or cost, or the answer depends on which models run. Ask at most once per chat. If the need is also unclear, ask both questions together. Offer two choices:

- Now: give them `/setup-pstack` to type, and answer their question too.
- Later: answer their question, and add one line saying every role keeps its default model until they run `/setup-pstack`.

## Get set up

1. On this profile, skills live in `~/.pstack/skills` and agents in `~/.pstack/agents`; Claude reads them natively and Codex through the symlinks in `codex/skills`.
2. Read [`setup-pstack`](../setup-pstack/SKILL.md) before changing the role sheet. Keep explicit activation.
3. Give one task prompt with a goal and a check that can pass or fail, using [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md). Claude uses `/<skill>`; Codex uses `$<skill>`.

If cost is the worry, say where the tokens go and how to spend fewer. pstack spends extra tokens on subagents and review panels. Rerun `/setup-pstack` and pick a smaller budget or cheaper models. A role set to `auto` or `inherit-parent` runs on the chat's model, which saves tokens when the chat runs on Auto or a cheaper model. A shorter panel list runs fewer subagents, one for each entry. Save `/poteto-mode` for work that needs rigor.

## Start a task with `/poteto-mode`

`/poteto-mode` matches the task to a playbook, copies the playbook's steps into the todo list, and runs the other skills as the steps need them. A step it skips stays in the list as `skip: <reason>`. A good prompt states the goal and how to tell it's done. It doesn't list skills, because a hand-written sequence tends to drop or reorder steps the playbook would keep. Read [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md) before you help word one. [Guide page 2](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) has examples.

On this profile, explicit activation continues for the authorized task across turns and is included in delegated briefs. Start a separate task with a fresh explicit activation. T3 delegation uses `delegate_task`, not Cursor Custom Modes or a `subagent_type` field.

## Pick a skill

The default answer is `/poteto-mode`, which runs most of the others when its steps need them. Name a skill directly when the user wants more or less of something than the playbook gives. Read the skill before you recommend it, and give one example prompt.

If a skill directory next to this one is missing from the table, read its frontmatter and route by its description. The `principle-*` directories are covered under principles below.

Close calls:

- `/how` explains what the code does. `/why` explains the reasons. `/teach` runs one or both and explains the result plainly.
- `/arena` gives every worker the same brief and merges the best parts. `/swarm` splits work into slices or a race and returns one report.
- `/architect` implements right after it settles the design. Add "with checkpoint" to review the design before it writes code.
- `/interrogate` reviews the diff. `/blast-radius` looks for breakage outside the diff and proves the one fact that makes the change safe.
- `/recall` rebuilds context across recent chats. `/ketchup` covers only this chat since the user's last message. Resuming one specific chat or branch is the Session pickup playbook.
- `/figure-it-out` designs one rigorous run. The Orchestrate playbook runs a program that spans days and many PRs. The Autonomous run playbook drives one task to a finish condition.

Not in pstack:

- `/deslop` is bundled here. Driver selection follows [profile routing](../poteto-mode/references/claudep-routing.md) and shared verify-change.
- In T3, `watch_pull_request` owns PR monitoring and `schedule_task` supplies authorized recurring program wakes.
- Pstack has no orchestrate skill. Orchestrate is a `/poteto-mode` playbook. An orchestrate entry in the slash menu belongs to another plugin.

## Playbooks and principles

Playbooks are step lists inside `/poteto-mode`, not skills, so they have no slash command. Inside `/poteto-mode`, describing the task picks one, and these phrases name one directly:

- "babysit this pr" or "check on pr 123" runs Babysit. It drives the PR to merge-ready and stops there. It doesn't merge unless the user asks to merge, land, or ship.
- "land the stack" runs Shipping.
- "take over this branch" runs Session pickup.
- "pause safely" runs Pause safely.
- "full autopilot on this queue" runs Autopilot-full. "stack them, don't ship" runs Autopilot-stack.
- "run the eval playbook" runs Eval.

Invoke `/babysit` explicitly for standalone Pstack PR monitoring. The Playbooks section of [`poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) lists every playbook and when it applies. [Guide page 6](../poteto-mode/playbooks/opening-a-pr.md) covers opening, babysitting, and landing a PR.

Planning can use the harness plan mode. For work that spans phases or stacked PRs, asking `/poteto-mode` for a plan runs the [Multi-phase plan playbook](../poteto-mode/playbooks/multi-phase-plan.md), which writes the plan and doesn't implement it. For a design question, the Prototype playbook or `/architect` settles it in code first.

Principles are one-rule skills that `/poteto-mode` reads and cites in its replies. The user rarely invokes one. They steer with the names instead, as in "apply prove it works. show me the real output." Typing `/principle-<name>` still loads one on demand. [Guide page 8](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md#principles) lists them.

## Fix a run that went wrong

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| The mode stopped applying after a few turns | Confirm explicit task activation and that each child brief carries it through profile routing. |
| A question got treated as the next step of the last task | Say "new task", or say the turn doesn't need the mode. |
| A new model choice had no effect | Read the canonical role sheet, call `orchestrator_capabilities`, and check the child selection with `t3_thread_configuration`. |
| Runs cost more than expected | See the cost paragraph under Get set up. |
| A skill did not load on its own | Skills on this profile are explicit-only; activated playbooks read helper files directly. |
| Parallel agents overwrote each other | Give each agent its own worktree, or run them as cloud agents, which each get their own machine. |
| An overnight run moved but finished nothing | Use a pass/fail completion check and an authorized persistent wake through profile routing. |
| The reply claims success from a green build | Ask for the real command, flow, stored value, or profile. That's the prove-it-works principle. |

For a run that drifts, [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md) has one-line steers. [Guide page 10](references/recipes.md) has more pitfalls and the recipes worth copying.

## Make pstack my own

- [`/automate-me`](../automate-me/SKILL.md) drafts a personal mode skill from the user's own history, to use alongside `/poteto-mode`.
- [`/reflect`](../reflect/SKILL.md) after a session turns its lessons into skill edits the user approves.
- `/poteto-mode write a skill for <workflow>` runs the authoring playbook. The eval playbook tests a skill change blind.
- Fix a misbehaving skill in its own PR, not inside the feature work where it went wrong.

[Guide page 9](../reflect/SKILL.md) covers each of these.

## Reply

Lead with the answer. Give at most one example prompt in a code block, adapted from [`references/recipes.md`](references/recipes.md) when one fits, then the link to that file. Keep it short unless the user asked for the whole map.
